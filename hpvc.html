		<p>I was a member of team Pinak which is formed on 1st january with 10 members under the guidence of Dr. Ashok Dargar. We modelled the two-wheeler, semi-recumbent, 6-Speed, Front wheel driver, with under-seat steering human powered vehicle. The objective of creating Pinak was to provide both eco and pocket-friendly alternative to the everyday commuters, which is not too bulky, and ensures optimum rider safety and comfort while driving in heavy traffic and leisure rides. In this project we have designed the Pinak in Fusion 360 and done the analysis in Ansys to ensure the safety. We have also take part in HPVC conducted by ASME.<br>
		In this project I have modelled the frame in Fusion 360 and done CFD and FEM analysis in ansys and other analysis like power speed modelling are also done by me in MATLAB.<br>
